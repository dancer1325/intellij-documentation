# RMI compiler

Item| Description  
---|---  
Enable RMI stubs generation| Use this item to analyze compiled classes, searching where the remote interface is implemented. If such classes are not found, IntelliJ IDEA generates stubs for these interfaces incrementally. Only the classes generated by IntelliJ IDEA are analyzed. Classes generated by the other tools are ignored.  
Generate IIOP stubs| If enabled, makes the compiler generate IIOP stubs.  
Generate debugging info| If enabled, makes the compiler include the information necessary to run this class in the debugger.  
Generate no warnings| If this option is enabled, the compiler omits warnings about dubious usages of language constructs.  
Additional command line parameters| Enter or edit any additional arguments to be passed to the compiler via the command line. For more information, refer to the compiler documentation.
