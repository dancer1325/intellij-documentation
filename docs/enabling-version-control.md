## Associate a project root with a version control system

IntelliJ IDEA allows you to quickly enable your project's integration with a version control system and associate it with the project root. For more information about associating separate project directories with different version control systems, refer to [Associate a directory with a version control system](#associate_directory_with_VCS).

  1. Press `Alt+`` to open the VCS Operations Popup and select Enable Version Control Integration.

Alternatively, go to VCS | Enable Version Control Integration.

  2. In the Enable Version Control Integration dialog that opens, select a version control system that you want to associate with your project root. 

  3. After VCS integration is enabled, IntelliJ IDEA will ask you whether you want to share project settings files via VCS. You can choose Always Add to synchronize project settings with other repository users who work with IntelliJ IDEA.
