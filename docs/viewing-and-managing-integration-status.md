# View and manage integration status

With the extended [Merge Info](viewing-and-fast-processing-of-changelists.html) functionality, you can view and update changelists' integration status.

Subversion stores the information on whether a changelist has been integrated into the local working copy or not. Based on this data, IntelliJ IDEA informs you on the integration status of a specific changelist by displaying one of the following icons next to it:

  * ![merged.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/merged.png) integrated

  * ![notMerged.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/notMerged.png) not integrated

  * ![integrationStatusUnknown.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/integrationStatusUnknown.png) integration status unknown

  * ![commonHistory.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/commonHistory.png) common history




To have the integration status displayed, click the Highlight Integrated button ![highlightIntegrated.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/highlightIntegrated.png) on the Merge Info pane toolbar.

You can change the integration status of a changelist without actually integrating it into the working copy or reverting the previous integration. This will affect only the administrative data.

To toggle the integration status of a changelist, do one of the following:

  * To mark a changelist as Integrated, select it and click the Mark As Merged button ![markAsMerged.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/markAsMerged.png) on the Merge Info pane toolbar.

  * To mark a changelist as Not integrated, select it and click the Mark As Not Merged button ![markAsNotMerged.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/markAsNotMerged.png) on the Merge Info pane toolbar.
