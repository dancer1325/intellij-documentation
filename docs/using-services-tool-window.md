## Run/Debug configurations

You can manage multiple run/debug configurations in the [Services](services-tool-window.html) tool window. For example, you can start, pause, and stop several applications, track their status, and examine application-specific details.

### Add Run/Debug configurations to the Services window

  1. Select View | Tool Windows | Services from the main menu or press `Alt+8`.

  2. In the Services tool window, click Add service, then select Run Configuration Type.

  3. Select a run/debug configuration type from the list to add all configurations of this type to the window.
