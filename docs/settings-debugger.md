---|---  
Show debug window on breakpoint| If this checkbox is selected, IntelliJ IDEA activates the [Debug tool window](debug-tool-window.html) on hitting a breakpoint.  
Focus application on breakpoint| If this checkbox is selected, on hitting a breakpoint, IntelliJ IDEA will show the location of this breakpoint in the editor and will attempt to bring its frame to the front.  
Hide debug window on process termination| Automatically hide the [Debug tool window](debug-tool-window.html) when the debugged program terminates.  
Scroll execution point to center| If this checkbox is selected, the line with the current execution point will be kept in the middle of the screen.  
Click line number to perform run to cursor| If this checkbox is selected, you can click a line number in the editor to [run program execution to this line](stepping-through-the-program.html#run-to-cursor).  
Remove breakpoint| Select how you want to remove breakpoints:

  * By clicking them with the left mouse button
  * By dragging them to the editor or clicking them with the middle mouse button. In this case, clicking a breakpoint will toggle its state between enabled and disabled.
