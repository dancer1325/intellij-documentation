## Toolbox App

If you are using the Toolbox App, you can change the maximum allocated heap size for a specific IDE instance without starting it.

  1. Open the Toolbox App, click the settings icon next to the relevant IDE instance, and select Settings.

  2. On the instance settings tab, expand Configuration and specify the heap size in the Maximum heap size field.




If the IDE instance is currently running, the new settings will take effect only after you restart it.
