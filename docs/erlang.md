# Erlang

Support for developing applications based on [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [Erlang](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7083-erlang) plugin from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation about Erlang support in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2023.3/erlang.html).
