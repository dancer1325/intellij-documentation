## Message List

All the problem reports are displayed in a table which consists of two columns, Description and Location, and a summary below.

![Dart Analysis tool window: Messages pane](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/tool_window_dart_analysis.png)

  * The Description column shows the message itself, which can be an error message, a warning, or a hint.

  * The Location column shows the following data:

    * The name of the Dart package in which the problem arose. The Dart package name corresponds to the `project name` from pubspec.yaml.

    * The relative path from the Dart package root to the file where the problem arose.

    * The line number where the problem arose.

  * The header of the tool window shows the number of detected errors, warnings, or hints as well as the filter status.
