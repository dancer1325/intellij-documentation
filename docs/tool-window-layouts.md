# Layouts

IntelliJ IDEA lets you [move tool windows](manipulating-the-tool-windows.html#move-tool-windows), [change their view modes](viewing-modes.html), [resize them](manipulating-the-tool-windows.html#resize-tool-windows), and save these settings as layouts. You can have several tool window layouts and switch between them when needed.

When you start working with the IDE, there is one existing Default layout with factory settings. You can't customize this layout option. It's a quick way to return your workspace to its default appearance.

### Create a custom layout

Once you [move](manipulating-the-tool-windows.html#move-tool-windows), [resize](manipulating-the-tool-windows.html#resize-tool-windows) your tool windows or [change their view mode](viewing-modes.html), you can either update the currently used setup or save these changes as a new layout.

  1. In the main menu, go to Window | Layouts and select Save Current Layout as New.

  2. Name the new layout and click Save.

### Change an existing layout

If you already have a custom layout, and you modified it, you can save the changes to this existing layout. Alternatively, you can save this arrangement as a new layout.

  * In the main menu, go to Window | Layouts and select Save Changes in Current Layout.




### Switch between layouts

  * In the main menu, go to Window | Layouts, point to the required layout and select Apply.

Your currently selected layout is marked with a checkmark.

  * Use the quick switcher: press `Ctrl+`` (View | Quick Switch Scheme), click Layout, and select the name of the layout that you want to apply.




### Restore the arrangement of tool windows

  * To restore the Default layout, in the main menu, go to Window | Layouts | Default or press `Shift+F12`.




### Edit a layout

  * In the main menu, go to Window | Layouts, point to the required layout and select Rename or Delete.

You can't delete your current layout, and you can't edit or delete the Default layout.
