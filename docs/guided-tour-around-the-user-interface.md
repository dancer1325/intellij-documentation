## Navigation bar

Focus: `Alt+Home`

Show/hide: View | Appearance | Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is a quick alternative to the Project view, where you can go through the structure of your project, open specific files, and jump to specific code elements in the current file.

It is located in the status bar at the bottom of the main window. You can change its location: in the main menu, go to View | Appearance | Navigation Bar and select Top to display the navigation bar in the top part of the IDE window or Don't show to disable it.
