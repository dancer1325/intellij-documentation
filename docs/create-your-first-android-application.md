Support for developing [Android](https://www.android.com/) applications is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [Android](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22989-android) and [Android Design Tools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22990-android-design-tools) plugins from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation about the Android support in IntelliJ IDEA in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2024.1/create-your-first-android-application.html).
