Path| Path to a file or a directory that you want to associate with a data source or a set of data sources.  
Resolution Scope| A data source or a set of data sources that will be associated with a file or a directory.If you add a mapping for a directory with files that are already associated with a data source, the IDE displays a notification dialog.
