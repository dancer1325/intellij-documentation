It incorporates the [Dart Virtual Machine](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-vm), the [Dart core Libraries](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries), as well as all the command-line tools, including compilers ([dart2js](https://dart.dev/tools/dart2js) and [dartdevc](https://dart.dev/tools/dartdevc)), the [dartfmt](https://dart.dev/tools/dartfmt) code formatter, and the [pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd) tool.
