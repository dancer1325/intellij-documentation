## Prerequisites for working with Docker on a remote server

Before you start working with Docker on a remote machine, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

  * A local [Docker CLI](faq-about-dev-containers.html#docker_cli), which is necessary for connecting to the remote Docker instance. You can either install Docker Desktop or just Docker CLI.

  * [Docker Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx#manual-download) plugin, which is necessary for building images from Dockerfile. Note that using Buildx with Docker requires Docker Engine version 19.03 or later.




For Dev Containers on a remote server, refer to [Limitations](dev-container-limitations.html).
