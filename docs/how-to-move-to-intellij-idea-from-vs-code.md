## Import settings

To help you recreate your previous setup, IntelliJ IDEA allows you to import settings from your VS Code instance. This includes your keymap, a UI theme set, installed extensions, and recent projects.

If you skip import on the first launch, you can [manually import your settings](sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) later or configure them from scratch as described later in this guide.

When you launch your IntelliJ IDEA for the first time, you will see the Import Settings dialog with the list of other IDE's settings found on your machine.

  1. Select Visual Studio Code to import settings.

  2. Select which settings you want to import and click Import Settings.

You will see a confirmation that the settings have been successfully imported.
