## Before you start

  1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download). 

To use Prettier configuration files written in TypeScript, make sure your Node.js version is 22.6.0 or later. 

  2. Make sure a local Node.js runtime is configured in your project: open the Settings dialog (`Ctrl+Alt+S`) and go to Languages & Frameworks | JavaScript Runtime. The Node runtime field shows the default project Node.js runtime. Learn more from [Configuring a local Node.js interpreter](developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_configure_local_node_interpreter). 

  3. Make sure the JavaScript and TypeScript and Prettier required plugins are enabled on the Settings | Plugins page, tab Installed. For more information, refer to [Managing plugins](managing-plugins.html).
