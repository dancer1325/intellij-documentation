# Clean up local working copy

The Cleanup command in Subversion can be helpful in the following situations:

  * Your local working copy is in an inconsistent state because a Subversion command was interrupted.

  * The timestamp of a file has changed while its content remains intact.




To clean up the local working copy, do one of the following:

  * Select the desired file or directory in the [Project](project-tool-window.html) tool window and choose Subversion | Cleanup from the context menu of the selection.

  * Open the desired file in the editor and choose VCS | Subversion | Cleanup from the main menu.

  * Select the desired file or directory in the Commit window and choose Subversion | Cleanup from the context menu of the selection.
