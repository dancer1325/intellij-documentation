# Pull changes from the Mercurial upstream (Pull)

Refreshing a local Mercurial repository with the changes from the remote repository (Pull) involves retrieving changes and applying them to the local data. The Mercurial integration with IntelliJ IDEA provides interface for specifying the mandatory Pull settings and for customizing the Pull procedure.

  1. In the main menu, go to Hg | Mercurial | Pull.

  2. Specify the required URL address of the source remote repository.
