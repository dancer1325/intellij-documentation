## Quick way

### Run from the editor

If you are not going to pass any parameters to your program, and your program does not require any specific actions to be performed before start, you can run it right from the editor.

The class that you are going to execute must contain a `main()` method with a valid signature, for example: `public static void main(String[] args)`.
