# AI Assistant in JetBrains IDEs

![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/intellij.ml.llm.core.icons.aiAssistantColored.svg) AI Assistant enhances your development workflow with intelligent features that integrate directly into your IDE. Key capabilities include:

  * **Code completion** – autocomplete single lines and entire blocks of code, ensuring adherence to your coding style and naming conventions.

  * **Next edit suggestions** – get suggestions for the next possible edits to your code. Quickly apply a suggestion and jump to the next place that might need a change, updating related code throughout the file.

  * **AI Chat with agent mode** – chat with one of the supported language models, ask questions about your project, or iterate on a task. Switch to agent mode to perform more complex activities such as implementing fixes, refactoring code, generating tests, and more.

  * **Context management** – add files, folders, images, symbols, commits, or other items to give AI Assistant additional context related to your question.

  * **Response processing** – review and apply changes suggested by the AI. Modify single or multiple files, apply code snippets, or run terminal commands directly from AI Chat.

  * **Cloud-based LLMs support** – select your preferred AI model to work in AI Chat. Choose from cloud providers like Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

  * **Use of local models** – set up custom local models provided by third-parties and use them for AI Assistant features such as code completion, in-editor code generation, or commit message generation.
