## When is profiling helpful?

Profiling tools help you:

  * Identify bugs, bottlenecks and diagnose poor performance

  * Identify hot spots and opportunities for optimization (not necessarily related to a performance problem)

  * Assess or compare the performance of different solutions

  * Get a better understanding of how a program operates under the hood
