## Import settings

To help you recreate your previous setup, IntelliJ IDEA allows you to import settings from your Cursor instance. This includes your keymap, a UI theme set, installed extensions, and recent projects.

If you skip import on the first launch, you can [manually import your settings](sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) later or configure them from scratch as described later in this guide.

When you launch your IntelliJ IDEA for the first time, you will see the Import Settings dialog with the list of other IDE's settings found on your machine.

  1. Select Cursor to import settings.

  2. Select which settings you want to import and click Import Settings.

     * UI Theme – select if you want to import the theme settings. 

     * Keymap – select if you want to import the keyboard shortcuts. Click Show all to review the list of shortcuts that will be imported.

     * Plugins – select if you want to import the extensions you used in Cursor. These extensions will be substituted with corresponding plugins from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/). Click Show all to review the list of plugins that will be installed. 

In addition to the extensions you're migrating, the [AI Assistant plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22282-jetbrains-ai-assistant) will also be installed. This plugin powers all [AI features](#migrate_from_cursor_replicate_workflows_ai_features) in JetBrains IDEs, including code completion, chat, and inline actions.

     * Recent Projects – select if you want to import the projects you were working on in Cursor.

You will see a confirmation that the settings have been successfully imported.
