## Create a Page Object

Prior to creating a Page Object, make sure that Selenium libraries are added to the classpath. Otherwise, the functionality will not be available.

  1. In the Project tool window, right-click the directory where you want to store the Page Object and select New | Selenium Page Object.

  2. Select the implementation language, framework, and give the Page Object a name.

  3. (Optional) Provide a URL of the web page for which you are creating a Page Object.

![New Selenium Page Object](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/new_selenium_page_object.png)

If configured, the specified web page will be opened in Web Inspector once the Page Object is created. You can then proceed to add the required elements to the Page Object.

  4. (Optional) If needed, you can customize the Page Object template. For more information, refer to [Customize Page Object template](#customize_template).

  5. Click OK.




As a result, a new Page Object is created.
