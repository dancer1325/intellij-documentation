## Before you start

  1. Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on your computer. 

  2. Install and enable the Cordova plugin on the Settings | Plugins page, tab Marketplace, as described in [Installing plugins from JetBrains Marketplace](managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo). 

  3. Download and install an emulator tool depending on the target platform and the operating system you use. Learn more from the [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/#develop-for-platforms) official website.

  4. To emulate the [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) platform, install the [ios-sim](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-sim) and [ios-deploy](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy) command-line tools globally. 

Open the embedded Terminal (`Alt+F12`) and type:

`npm install -g ios-sim`

`npm install -g ios-deploy`
