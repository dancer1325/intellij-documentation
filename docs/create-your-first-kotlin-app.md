## Create a new project

In IntelliJ IDEA, a project helps you organize everything that is necessary for developing your application in a single unit.

  1. On the Welcome screen, click New Project. Alternatively, in the main menu, go to File | New | Project.

  2. From the list on the left, select Kotlin.

  3. Name your new project and change its location if necessary.

  4. Select the Gradle IntelliJ Maven build system.

  5. Choose the Groovy Kotlin language for the build script.

  6. From the JDK list, select the [JDK](sdk.html#jdk) that you want to use in your project.

If the JDK is installed on your computer, but not defined in the IDE, select Add JDK and specify the path to the JDK home directory.

If you don't have the necessary JDK on your computer, select Download JDK.

If you don't know which distribution to choose, and you don't have specific requirements that instruct you to use one of the existing distributions, use Oracle OpenJDK.

For more information about JDK and how to install it, see the [Java Development Kit (JDK) guide](sdk.html#jdk).

  7. Enable the Add sample code option to create a file with a sample `Hello World!` application.
