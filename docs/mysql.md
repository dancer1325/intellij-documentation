### Before you begin

This topic presents a general procedure on how you can create a data source for the [connection](connecting-to-a-database.html) to your MySQL database in IntelliJ IDEA, and run a test connection. It is assumed that you already have the necessary connection details and the database is up and running.

For example, if you want to run a database on your machine and connect to that database, the corresponding DBMS software must be installed on the machine first.

To learn about your DBMS software, refer to its [official documentation](#official_information_links).
