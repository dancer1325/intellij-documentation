## What is Code With Me?

Code With Me is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs (except for Rider and DataGrip for now) that enables you to collaboratively review, edit, and debug code with your colleagues in real time. The service provided by Code With Me is available in IntelliJ IDEA with the Ultimate subscription and without it (with session time limits in the free version). 

Since version 2021.1, the Code With Me plugin comes as a bundled one in the supported IDEs; you don't need to install it manually.
