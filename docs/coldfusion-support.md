# ColdFusion

Support for developing web applications on the [ColdFusion platform](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [CFML plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14586-cfml) from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for ColdFusion in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2020.1/coldfusion-support.html).
