## Import an Eclipse project to IntelliJ IDEA

You can import either an Eclipse workspace or a single Eclipse project. To do this, click Open on the Welcome Screen or select File | Open in the main menu.

If your project uses a build tool such as [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), we recommend selecting the associated build file pom.xml or build.gradle when importing the project. For more information about importing a project, refer to [Import a project from Eclipse](import-project-from-eclipse-page-1.html).

If you'd like to import your existing run configurations from Eclipse, consider using this [third-party plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7153-eclipser).
