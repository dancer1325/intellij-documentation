# Gutter Icons

Gutter icons are located in the [editor on the left](editor-gutter.html). They invoke some basic actions and other framework- and technology-specific features.

Use this settings page to hide or show icons in the gutter. 

Note that technology-related icons are displayed only if the corresponding plugin is installed and enabled. For more information about installing plugins, refer to [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

The gutter also allows you to [fold code](working-with-source-code.html#code_folding), marks [modified lines](adding-files-to-version-control.html#file_status) for projects under version control, and shows code coverage results.

To display or hide an icon in the gutter, select or clear the checkbox next to it. If you want to disable all gutter icons, clear the Show gutter icons checkbox above the list of available icons.
