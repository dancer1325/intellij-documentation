## Open the Remote Host tool window

The tool window is available only when the FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity bundled plugin is enabled. The plugin is active by default. If not, activate it in the [Plugins](plugins-settings.html) page of the [Settings](settings-preferences-dialog.html) dialog.

  * Tools | Deployment | Browse Remote Host.

  * View | Tool Windows | Remote Host (available in the tool windows list only if it has previously been opened from Tools | Deployment | Browse Remote Host).
