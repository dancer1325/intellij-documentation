# Data Science and ML tools

The following is only valid when the Python plugin is [installed and enabled](managing-plugins.html).

IntelliJ IDEA supports the following tools for data science and machine learning:

  * [Formats for data view](matplotlib-support.html#data)

The Data View tool window supports [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays and [pandas dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

  * [Data visualization formats](matplotlib-tutorial.html#run)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) provide a set of Python plotting libraries.

  * [Jupyter notebooks](jupyter-notebook-support.html)

IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with data visualization.

With the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) integration available in IntelliJ IDEA through the Python plugin you can edit, execute, and debug notebook source code and examine execution outputs including stream data, images, and other media.
