# Define the set of changelists to display

With the extended [Merge Info](viewing-and-fast-processing-of-changelists.html) functionality, you can limit the set of changelists to be displayed in the [Changelists](version-control-tool-window-repository-and-incoming-tabs.html#left) pane to changelists that have been integrated from one specific branch to another. These branches are referred to as "source" and "target" respectively.

To define the set of branches you want to display, do the following:

  1. Open the Version Control tool window `Alt+9` and switch to the [Repository tab](version-control-tool-window-repository-and-incoming-tabs.html).

  2. To open the Merge Info pane, click the Highlight Integrated button ![Highlight integrated](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/highlightIntegrated.png) on the toolbar.

  3. In the From field, specify the URL address of the source branch.

  4. In the To field, specify the path to the target branch. If necessary, use the Browse button ![the Browse button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.general.ellipsis.svg) to open the [Select Branch](select-branch.html) dialog.

  5. Specify the path to the local working copy to which you are going to apply patches created based on the selected changelists. If necessary, use Browse ![the Browse button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.general.ellipsis.svg) to open the Configure Working Copy Paths dialog.
