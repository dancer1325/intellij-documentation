## Views

The tool window has several views:

  * Project view. This view displays all the project items along with their dependencies (SDKs and libraries) . The emphasis is on the directory structure, although the packages are also shown. 

  * Packages view. This view emphasizes the package structure of the project. Modules, SDKs, and libraries, are not displayed by default.

  * Scope views (Project Files, Open Files, and so on). These views display the contents of the predefined and user-defined [scopes](configuring-scopes-and-file-colors.html). 




To switch between views, press `Alt+Right`/`Alt+Left` or select a view from the list on the header.

You can also display each view in a separate tab: click ![Settings](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.expui.general.moreVertical.svg) and disable the Group Tabs option.
