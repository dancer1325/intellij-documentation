## Unified IntelliJ IDEA Overview

Previously, IntelliJ IDEA was offered as two separate products: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate with extended capabilities.

Starting with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, we're combining these two editions into a single, unified product: **IntelliJ IDEA**. This change allows all users to access essential functionality without needing to decide between editions.

The core functionality of IntelliJ IDEA remains free and now comes with even more features compared to the former Community Edition. Additionally, the new Ultimate subscription gives you access to advanced tooling with a free 30-day trial available for all users when installing IntelliJ IDEA.

Afterward, you can choose to subscribe to get an Ultimate experience or continue using IntelliJ IDEA for free.
