# Supported Node.js versions

This page lists all Node.js versions supported by IntelliJ IDEA for developing applications. Find the Node.js release schedule with the information about the status of the release on the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

The following Node.js versions are supported in IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3 and later:

  * Node.js 22 - the Active Long Term Supported (LTS) version

  * Node.js 24 - the current version




The active Long Term Service (LTS) version of Node.js is used for ongoing testing of existing and upcoming product features.

For other supported Node.js versions, we guarantee that any regressions found in the current IntelliJ IDEA version related to the Node.js support or tool integrations that use Node.js (for example test runners or linters) will be fixed in the following bugfix updates or next IDE major update.

We can't guarantee that all IntelliJ IDEA features will work as expected with Node.js versions that have reached their end-of-life. If any regressions or bugs associated with these Node.js versions are identified in the current IntelliJ IDEA version, they will not be fixed.
