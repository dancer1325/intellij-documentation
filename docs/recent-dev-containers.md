## Recent projects

When you close your project, you can choose how to handle the Dev Container. You can close the project and keep the Dev Container active, or you can close the project and also stop running the Dev Container.

All the recent Dev Containers are displayed on the welcome screen under the Dev Containers node for local projects or under the remote server name. You can rebuild, stop, and delete recent Dev Containers right from the welcome screen of IntelliJ IDEA. You can also collect logs for the selected Dev Container.
