# GWT

Support for developing web applications based on [Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/) (GWT) is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [GWT plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14590-gwt) from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for GWT in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2020.1/gwt.html).
