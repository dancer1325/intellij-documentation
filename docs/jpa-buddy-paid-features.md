## Liquibase

Prior to 2024.1, support for Liquibase was included in the JPA Buddy plugin. Starting from 2024.1, Liquibase is a plugin bundled in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

**Diff Liquibase changelog generation** is an extremely useful feature that saves a lot of time from routine work. By using it, you can automatically generate a Liquibase changelog that contains all required code to update the database, so it complies with your JPA model. Diff changelog can be generated by comparing your JPA entities with a database, two databases, or even JPA entities from one VCS branch and JPA entities from another, which is very useful when you don't have access to the target database.

Also, JPA Buddy provides **Init schema Liquibase changelog** action that helps developers to generate a database schema from scratch. It can use your JPA entities or existing database as a source. As a result, you will get a Liquibase changelog with all required commands for schema initialization. This feature can be extremely helpful if you integrate Liquibase into your existing application or decide to generate a single script for DB initialization instead of running tons of old changelogs. Also, it may help to set up new development or testing environments.
