## Overview

In the Database tool window, you can work with databases and DDL [data sources](managing-data-sources.html#data_sources). You can view and modify data structures in your databases and perform other associated tasks.

The available data sources are shown as a tree of data sources, schemas, tables, and so on.

If no data sources are currently defined, use the [New](#new) command `Alt+Insert` to create a data source and connect to a database. For more information about data sources, refer to [Data sources](managing-data-sources.html) topic.

Once IntelliJ IDEA is connected to a database, Database tool window will display the [introspected](glossary-database-tools-and-sql.html#introspection) database objects. For more information about database tree viewing options, refer to [View Options](#view_options) chapter. For more information about working with database objects in IntelliJ IDEA, refer to the corresponding object topics.

Most of the functions in this window are accessed by using the toolbar icons or context menu commands. Many of the commands have keyboard shortcuts.

If the toolbar is not currently shown, click ![the Options icon](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.expui.general.moreVertical.svg) Options on the header and select Show Toolbar.
