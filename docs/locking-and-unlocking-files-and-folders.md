# Lock and unlock files and folders

Though Subversion integration allows you to successfully modify and merge files changed by different team members, sometimes it makes sense to lock files (for example, images) to avoid overwriting changes.

### Lock a file

  1. Select the file you want to lock in the [Project tool window](project-tool-window.html) or open it in the editor.

  2. Select VCS | Subversion | Lock from the main menu, or Subversion | Lock from the context menu of the selection.

  3. Enter a lock comment in the [Lock File](lock-file-dialog-subversion.html) dialog that opens. 




### Unlock a file

  1. Select the file you want to unlock, or open it in the editor.

  2. Select VCS | Subversion | Unlock from the main menu, or Subversion | Unlock from the context menu of the selection.

To forcibly break a lock set by somebody else, select the Steal Existing Lock checkbox.
