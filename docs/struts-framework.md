# Struts

Support for developing applications based on the Struts framework is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [Struts 1.x and Tiles](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/110-struts-1-x-and-tiles) from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for Struts in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2019.1/struts-framework.html).
