## Run an Angular application

  1. Сlick ![the Run icon](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.expui.run.run.svg) in the gutter next to the `start` script in package.json, or execute the `npm run start` command in the Terminal `Alt+F12`, or double-click the `start` task in the [npm tool window](npm-tool-window.html) (View | Tool Windows | npm).

  2. Wait till the application is compiled and the development server is ready.

The Run tool window or the Terminal shows the URL at which your application is running. If your application was generated with @angular/cli, the default URL is http://localhost:4200/. Click this link to view the application.

### Run an Angular application via a run/debug configuration

For applications created with Angular CLI in the IntelliJ IDEA New Project wizard [as described above](angular.html#create_new_angular_app), IntelliJ IDEA generates an [npm](run-debug-configuration-npm.html) configuration with the default name Angular CLI Server. This configuration runs the `ng serve` command that launches the development server and starts your application in the development mode.

In other cases, you need to [create a run/debug configuration](#angular_running_and_debugging_run_via_rc_create_rc) with the actual settings, such as, host, port, etc., manually.

### Create an npm run/debug configuration

  1. Go to Run | Edit Configurations. Alternatively, select Edit Configurations from the Run widget on the toolbar. 

![Open the Edit Configurations dialog](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/angular_run_config_create.png)

In the Edit Configurations dialog that opens, click the Add button (![the Add button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.general.add.svg)) on the toolbar and select npm from the list. 

  2. In the Configuration tab of the Run/Debug Configurations: npm dialog that opens, specify the location of the package.json, the Node.js runtime, and the package manager to use.

In the Command field, select run from the list and then select the script to run from the Scripts list. Most likely it will be the default `start` script but you can configure another one in your package.json, for example, to run the application on a custom port.

  3. Optionally:

To open the application in the browser, update the configuration as follows: in the Browser / Live Edit tab, select the After launch checkbox, select the browser to open the application in, and specify the URL address at which the application wil run. 

If you are going to debug the application, select [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) or another [Chromium-based browser](https://www.chromium.org/).

### Run an application

  1. From the list in the Run widget on the toolbar, select a run configuration of the type npm. This can be the autogenerated Angular CLI Server configuration or a custom one that you created yourself [as described above](#angular_running_and_debugging_run_via_rc_create_rc).

  2. Click ![Run](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.actions.execute.svg).

  3. Wait till the application is compiled and the development server is ready.

The Run tool window or the Terminal shows the URL at which your application is running. If your application was generated with @angular/cli, the default URL is http://localhost:4200/. Click this link to view the application.

Alternatively, enable IntelliJ IDEA to open the application on start [as described above](#ws_angular_start_app_in_dev_mode_enable_opening_browser). 




When the development server is running, your application is automatically reloaded as soon as you change any of the source files and save the updates.
