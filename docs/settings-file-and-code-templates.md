---|---  
Includes| These are templates for reusable fragments that can be included in file templates. For more information, refer to [Reusable content in templates](parse-directive.html).  
Code| IntelliJ IDEA uses these built-in templates as snippets to generate various constructs. For example, to generate implemented or overridden methods. You can edit the templates available on this tab to modify how IntelliJ IDEA generates these constructs, but you cannot create new ones. To create custom code snippets, use [live templates](using-live-templates.html).  
Other| These templates are related to various application servers and frameworks.You can edit the existing templates, but you cannot create new ones.
