Support for the Space code collaboration platform is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [Space](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13362-space) plugin from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation about Space support in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2023.3/space.html).
