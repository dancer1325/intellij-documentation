## Enable JSON5

IntelliJ IDEA recognizes a number of most popular JSON standards, including [JSON5](https://json5.org/). IntelliJ IDEA by default treats files with the json5 extension as JSON5 files and supports this new syntax in them.

### Extend the JSON5 syntax to all JSON files

  1. In the Settings dialog (`Ctrl+Alt+S`) , go to Editor | File Types.

  2. In the Recognized File Types list, select JSON5.

  3. In the File Name Patterns area, click ![Add](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.general.add.svg) and type `*.json` in the Add Wildcard dialog that opens.
