# Integrate Perforce files

You can merge changes between the branches into your local working copy, using the branch specification, or a changelist.

The Integrate Project command is available for both Perforce and Subversion integrations.

Integration results display in the Integrate Info tab of the tool window. Context menu of a file enables you to compare versions, view history and annotations, browse changes and more.
