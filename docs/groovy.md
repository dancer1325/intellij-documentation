## User interface

The user interface for Groovy looks similar to a regular one. However, it includes the [Groovy console](launching-groovy-interaction-console.html) that you can open from the main menu (Tools | Groovy Console).

The most interesting part of the user interface is the IntelliJ IDEA [Editor](using-code-editor.html) since it lets you invoke almost any IDE feature without leaving it, which helps you organize a layout where you have more screen space because auxiliary controls like toolbars and windows are hidden.

Accessing a tool window via its shortcut moves the input focus to it, so you can use all keyboard commands in its context. When you need to go back to the editor, press `Escape`.

Below is a list of shortcuts that invoke the tool windows you will most often need:

Tool Window| Shortcut  
---|---  
Project| `Alt+1`  
Version Control| `Alt+9`  
Run| `Alt+4`  
Debug| `Alt+5`  
Terminal| `Alt+F12`  
Editor| `Escape`  
  
When you want to focus on the code, try the [Distraction Free Mode](ide-viewing-modes.html#distraction-free). It removes all toolbars, tool windows, and editor tabs. To switch to this mode, go to View | Appearance | Enter Distraction Free Mode in the main menu.

An alternative to Distraction Free Mode may be hiding all tool windows by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+F12`. You can restore the layout to its default by pressing this shortcut once again.

The Navigation Bar is a compact alternative to the [Project tool window](project-tool-window.html). To access the Navigation Bar, press `Alt+Home`.

Most components in IntelliJ IDEA (both tool windows and popups) provide [speed search](speed-search-in-the-tool-windows.html). This feature allows you to filter a list, or navigate to a particular item by using a search query.

When you don't know the shortcut for an action, try using the Find action feature by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+A`. Start typing to find an action by its name, see its shortcut or call it.
