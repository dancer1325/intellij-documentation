# OSGi

Support for developing applications based on the [OSGi framework](https://www.osgi.org/) is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [OSGi plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1816-osgi) from the JetBrains repository as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for the OSGi support in IntelliJ IDEA in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2020.1/osgi.html).
