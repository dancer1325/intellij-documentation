## Panes of the Duplicates tool window

The window consists of the following panes:

  * The left pane displays the tree view of the duplicate fragments of source code. Each node shows the following information:

    * The number of duplicated code fragments found in scope.

    * The 'cost' of the duplicate (which is an arbitrary unit calculated using an additive algorithm on the base of the code block size; generally, the larger is the code fragment, the higher is its cost).

    * The containing class where the duplicates are located.

  * The right pane shows the differences between the duplicated fragments of source code, selected in the left pane.
