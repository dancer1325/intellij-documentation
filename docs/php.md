## Include Path tab

The area displays the list of configured include paths. Include paths are used for holding [PHP libraries](library.html), that is, third-party code that is used for completion and reference resolution in some functions/methods that use file paths as arguments, for example, `require()` or `include()`. 

  * Use ![Add](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.toolbarDecorator.addFolder.svg) and ![Remove](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.general.remove.svg) to add and remove folder paths.

  * Use [Speed Search](speed-search-in-the-tool-windows.html) to search the list: start typing the item name right away or press `Ctrl+F` to display the search field.

  * Exclude the contents of a folder from [indexing](indexing.html). To do so, select the folder, click ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.modules.addExcludedRoot.svg) Exclude Under This Path on the toolbar, and in the file finder dialog that opens, select the path to the nested folder to exclude.
