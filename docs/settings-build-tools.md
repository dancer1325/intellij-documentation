# Build Tools

Use this page to configure the reloading process for your [Gradle](work-with-gradle-projects.html#gradle_refresh_project), [Maven](delegate-build-and-run-actions-to-maven.html#maven_reimport), or [sbt](sbt-support.html#reload_project) project.

Item| Description  
---|---  
Sync project after changes in the build scripts| When this option is selected, you can configure how to synchronize your project using the following options: 

  * Any changes: select this option if you want to automatically synchronize the project after any changes you make to the build script file or external changes.
  * External changes: when you select this option, IntelliJ IDEA automatically syncs the project only after the VCS changes and changes made to the build files outside the IDE.
