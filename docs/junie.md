JetBrains [Junie](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26104-jetbrains-junie-eap) is an AI coding agent developed by JetBrains. It can perform tasks independently or work alongside a developer. Routine tasks can be fully delegated to Junie, while it can also help with more complex work:

  * Performs tasks using project context and structure.

  * Analyzes and searches code to find relevant information.

  * Makes code edits using IDE inspections and checks.

  * Runs code and tests to reduce warnings and errors.

  * Verifies project state and test results after changes.

  * Supports collaboration on complex tasks with change review and guidance.




The Junie plugin is [compatible](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/junie/ide-compatibility.html) with IntelliJ IDEA and with some other JetBrains IDEs. Learn more on the Junie [website](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/) or in the official [Junie documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/junie/get-started-with-junie.html).
