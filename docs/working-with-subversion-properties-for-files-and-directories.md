## To view the properties of a file or directory

  1. In the [Project tool window](project-tool-window.html), select the desired file or directory under the SVN version control.

  2. From the main VCS menu, or from the context menu of the selection, choose Subversion | Edit Properties. The SVN Properties view will open showing the properties of the selected file.

  3. Use the toolbar buttons or the context menu commands to create, edit or delete properties, as described in the procedures below.




If you want the SVN Properties view to preserve its contents as you navigate through your project or edit files, make sure that the Follow Selection button ![Follow Selection](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.general.autoscrollFromSource.svg) is not pressed; otherwise the view will show the properties for the currently selected or edited file.
