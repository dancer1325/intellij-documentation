## Fork a project

A fork is your copy of a GitHub repository that allows you to make changes to code without affecting the original project.

### Create a fork

  * Open the project that you want to fork on [GitHub](https://github.com) and click ![fork icon](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/github_fork.png)




A copy of the original project will be created under your account. To make changes to this project, you need to [clone](manage-projects-hosted-on-github.html#clone-from-GitHub) it to create a local repository.

### Rebase a fork

  * In the main menu, go to Git | GitHub | Sync Fork. Your fork will be rebased onto the HEAD commit in the main branch of the original project you created your fork from.
