## Adding widget code to your Jupyter notebook

To add an interactive widget to your notebook, first add a code cell. 

To preview the widgets, you need to [execute](running-jupyter-notebook-cells.html#execute-cell) the corresponding code cell.

When you switch the IntelliJ IDEA theme, the background color of an interactive output changes once you execute the code cell
