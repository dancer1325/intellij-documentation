## Before you start

### Enable the FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity plugin

This functionality relies on the [FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13125-ftp-sftp-webdav-connectivity) plugin, which is bundled and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA by default. If the relevant features are not available, make sure that you did not disable the plugin. 

The FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity plugin is not available in IntelliJ IDEA without the Ultimate subscription. 

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Installed tab, find the FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity plugin, and select the checkbox next to the plugin name.
