# Compare with branch in Subversion

In addition to the common ways to compare file versions, you can use the special command that lets you compare a file from your local working copy with its version in the selected branch.

  1. Select the desired file in the [Project tool window](project-tool-window.html), or open it in the editor.

  2. From the main VCS menu, or the context menu of the selection, choose Subversion | Compare with Branch.

This action is also available in the SVN Repositories browser. Right-click the desired directory and choose the corresponding command from the context menu.

  3. In the Compare with Branch popup, select the desired branch. The Compare with Branch dialog in the form of the [Diff Viewer for files](differences-viewer.html) appears.
