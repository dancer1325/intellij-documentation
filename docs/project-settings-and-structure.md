## Project SDK

An SDK is a collection of tools that you need to develop an application for a specific software framework. If the necessary SDK is installed on your computer, but not defined in the IDE, select Add SDK | 'SDK name', and specify the path to the SDK home directory.

To develop Java-based applications, you need a JDK (Java Development Kit). For more information about setting up the project JDK, refer to [Set up the project JDK](sdk.html#set-up-jdk).

To view or edit the name and contents of the selected SDK, click Edit. For more information about SDK and how to work with them, refer to [SDKs](sdk.html).

For Gradle projects, refer to [Gradle JVM selection](gradle-jvm-selection.html) and for Maven projects, refer to [Change the JDK version in a Maven project](maven-support.html#change_jdk)
