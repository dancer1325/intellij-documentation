## Prerequisites

The environment used for running the app is referred to as target. For IntelliJ IDEA to run code on a target, the target has to define a language runtime, which represents something on the target that can be used by a run/debug configuration to run code. For example, the Application and Maven run/debug configurations would need a JDK and Maven respectively. 

In order to run your code on a target, all you need is to define the target execution environment in the [run/debug configuration](run-debug-configuration.html) that you would normally use for local run. After you have done that, launching the app on a target is no different than launching it locally.
