## Invoke refactoring

Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut for a specific refactoring.

You can also make a [multi-caret selection](multicursor.html#add-carets-at-selected-locations) for an extended range of refactoring operations, including Encapsulate Fields, Move Static Members, Extract Delegate, Extract Interface, and Extract Superclass. To utilize this feature, place the caret in each member you want to apply the refactoring to, and the IDE will automatically preselect and check these members in the refactoring dialog.




If you need to undo your refactoring, press `Ctrl+Z`.
