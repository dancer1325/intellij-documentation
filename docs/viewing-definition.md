## Type definitions

The Quick Type Definition feature allows you to view the type definition of variables, fields, methods, or any other symbols in a popup without switching from the code you're editing.

  * Place the caret at the symbol for which you want to view the type definition and select View | Quick Type Definition.

To open the source code of the definition for editing and close the popup, click the ![Options](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.actions.more.svg) icon and then click ![Edit](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.expui.general.edit.svg) Edit Source (`F4`).




IntelliJ IDEA doesn't have a default keyboard shortcut for this action, but you can manually configure it in the settings. For more information about configuring custom shortcuts, refer to [Configure keyboard shortcuts](configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html).
