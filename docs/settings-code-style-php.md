## Set from...

Click this link and choose the language to be used as the base for the current language code style. The list contains two options:

  * Language: choose this option to inherit the coding style settings from another language. Select the source language from the list, that opens. Only the settings that are applicable to the current language are taken. All the other settings are not affected.

  * Predefined code style: choose this option to use the coding standards defined for a specific framework. Select one of the following frameworks from the list:

    * [PEAR](https://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php)

    * [Zend](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/coding-standard.coding-style.html)

    * [Symfony2](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html). IntelliJ IDEA supports the official Symfony2 code style for [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/coding_standards.html) and automatically inserts one space after an opening pair of curvy braces and before a closing pair of curvy braces in Twig templates: `{{ some_variable }}`.

    * [PSR1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)/[PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)

    * [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/userguide2/general/styleguide.html)

    * [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/contributions#coding-style)

    * [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). If the PSR-12 code style is set, IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you to automatically enable the PSR-12-related code inspections.

    * [Drupal](https://drupal.org/coding-standards)

    * [Joomla!](https://www.joomla.org/)

    * [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/)
