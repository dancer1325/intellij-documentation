## Code With Me license

Code With Me offers different types of subscriptions that you can choose at the [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/buy/?fromIDE#personal?billing=yearly) website.

If you have an active IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate subscription or other IDE subscription (except for DataGrip and Rider), you don't need a separate Code With Me license as it's already included in the IDE's license.

If you have IntelliJ IDEA without the subscription, you have also the free version of Code With Me license included in it.

Free and Ultimate editions of Code With Me license differ with the number of guests that is allowed and time limits of the Code With Me session.

In case you have a free license but want to add more guests to your session or make it longer, then you can purchase a separate Premium Code With Me license.

There are several scenarios in which you might need to activate the Code With Me license manually:

  * You have an active IDE or an offline activation code and your license should be automatically applied to the Code With Me plugin. However, you if continue facing problems with the activation, activate the license [explicitly](#license_personal).

  * You have a commercial Code With Me license, and your company uses the JetBrains floating license server (FLS). In this case, you can [activate the license](#license_without_lobby) the same way you would activate the IntelliJ IDEA license.

  * Your company has commercial Code With Me licenses placed on internal lobby server. In this case, you activate the license [manually](#license_with_lobby) additionally specifying the lobby server address.

The status of the Code with Me plugin changes to Active. 

If you have a corporate license server with an IntelliJ IDEA license and you are experiencing timeout problems during the Code With Me session, your license server might be outdated (no plugins support). Contact your system administrator to update the license server or contact the JetBrains support (support-int@jetbrains.com).
