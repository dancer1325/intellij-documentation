## Monitor databases

Once you have established a connection to the AWS Glue server, the AWS Glue tool window becomes available. You can use it to monitor your databases, view schemas and partitions, and configure the way the data is displayed:

  * Use the Filter list to show local, foreign, or all databases.

  * Select a database and click ![Show and hide columns icon](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/bigdatatools-core.icons.table.configureColumns.svg) to show or hide columns from the database view.

  * Click the column headers to sort data by a column.

In the Location column, you can click the database URL to quickly open a directory in an S3 viewer. If the needed connection does not exist, this will open the connection creation form.
