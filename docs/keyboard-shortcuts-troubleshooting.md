## Are you using the right keymap?

First of all, check whether the shortcut should work as you expect. It may be obvious for shortcuts like `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`, but shortcuts like `Alt+Up` or `Ctrl+W` often perform different actions depending on the application and the operating system.

Taking into account different expectations regarding shortcuts, IntelliJ IDEA lets you choose between keymaps (predefined sets of shortcuts). If you worked with a specific editor or IDE before, you can switch to a keymap with the corresponding name, such as Eclipse, NetBeans, Sublime Text, or VSCode, and use the same shortcuts as in that editor or IDE. 

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Keymap.

  2. Make sure that you are using the correct keymap.

  3. Use the search field to check whether the shortcuts are mapped as expected.

Alternatively, you can select the necessary keymap at the top of this documentation page and check the list of shortcuts to study keyboard mappings in that keymap.
