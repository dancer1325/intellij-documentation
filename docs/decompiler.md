## Show bytecode for compiled files

By default, the IDE shows you decompiled code in compiled files. If necessary, you can open the bytecode viewer for any compiled class.

Open a compiled file in the editor and select View | Show Bytecode from the main menu.

The bytecode viewer provides basic syntax highlighting, and it shows the information in a way that is comfortable for reading.
