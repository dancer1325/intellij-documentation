## Create a notebook

Use one of the following options to create a new notebook:

  * On the Welcome Screen, open the Kotlin Notebook node and click New Notebook. You can create a notebook as a [scratch file](scratches.html) without adding it to a project, or within a new or existing project.

  * Right-click the directory in which you want to locate your notebook and select New | Kotlin Notebook.
