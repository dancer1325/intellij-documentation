## Language

IntelliJ IDEA is available in English but also includes bundled plugins that support Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.

If your operating system is in a supported language and your IntelliJ IDEA is in a different language, you will get a suggestion to align them. If you don't want to see this type of notification, you can [hide it](notifications.html#dont_show_suggestions).

### Enable the language pack plugin

This functionality relies on the [Chinese](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13710), [Japanese](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13964), and [Korean](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13711) language pack plugins, which are bundled and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA by default. If the relevant features aren't available, make sure that you didn't disable the plugin.

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Installed tab, find the required language pack plugin, and select the checkbox next to the plugin name.




### Change the UI language

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Appearance & Behavior | System Settings | Language and Region.

  2. Select the required language from the Language list.




Click Get More Languages... to install a different language as a third-party plugin from [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/). If the required language is not yet available, you can contribute by [developing your own language pack plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/providing-translations.html#language-packs).
