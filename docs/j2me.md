# J2ME

Support for developing applications based on [J2ME](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javameoverview.html) is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [J2ME](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12318-j2me) plugin from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for the J2ME support in IntelliJ IDEA in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2019.1/j2me.html).
