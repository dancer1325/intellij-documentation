## Before you start

  1. Make sure you have Node.js version 20 or later installed on your computer and configured as a [local Node.js runtime](developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_configure_local_node_interpreter).

  2. Install a loader. In the embedded Terminal (`Alt+F12`) , type:

     * `npm install --save-dev ts-node` to install `ts-node`

     * `npm install --save-dev tsx` to install `tsx`
