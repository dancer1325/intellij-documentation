## Before you start

  1. Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on your computer. Configure a Node.js runtime in your project as described in [Configuring a local Node.js interpreter](developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_configure_local_node_interpreter), in [Using Node.js on Windows Subsystem for Linux](developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_wsl), or in [Configuring remote Node.js runtimes](configuring-remote-node-interpreters.html). 

  2. Make sure the CSS and Tailwind CSS bundled plugins are enabled in the Installed tab of the Settings | Plugins page as described in [Managing plugins](managing-plugins.html).

  3. Make sure, the `tailwindcss` package is listed as a dependency in your package.json and you project is configured correctly, via an `@import "tailwindcss"` directive in a CSS file (TailwindCSS 4) or in a tailwind.config.js (TailwindCSS 3) file.

Alternatively, install and configure Tailwind CSS [as described below](#ws_css_tailwind_install_configure).
