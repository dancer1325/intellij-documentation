# Case

Change word casing options.

Use this page to configure formatting options for SQL files. When you change these settings, the Preview pane shows how this will affect your code.

Item| Description  
---|---  
Word Case| Switch word case of keywords and identifiers. The selected word case is applied automatically.

  * To upper: elements are automatically converted to the upper case.
  * To lower: elements are automatically converted to the lower case.
  * Do not change: The case of elements is left as is.

The Use original case checkbox applies the case that is used for names from the declaration throughout the whole file. For more information about the original case, refer to [Apply the original case from the declaration](configure-the-sql-code-style.html#apply-the-original-case-from-the-declaration).  
Quotation| Add quotation to identifiers.

  * Quote: the identifiers are automatically quoted.
  * Unquote: The identifiers are automatically unquoted.
  * Do not change: The identifiers are left as is.
