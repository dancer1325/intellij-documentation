## Code inspections with Qodana

On top of running code inspections in your IDE, you can inspect your code using [Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/):

  * Run IntelliJ IDEA inspections locally, including your IDE, and as a part of CI/CD pipelines.

  * Run resource-consuming inspections using your CI/CD infrastructure.

  * Enforce quality standards with quality gates in your CI system.

  * Share the same inspection profile, both within the IDE and the CI tool.

  * Access inspections that are available only in Qodana, such as security checks and license audits.

  * Access historical overviews of inspection results.

You can compare inspection results between commits to better understand your progress.
