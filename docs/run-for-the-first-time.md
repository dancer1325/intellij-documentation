## Import settings

If you skip import on the first launch, you can [manually import your settings from a ZIP archive](sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) later or [configure them from scratch](#configure-default-settings).

When you launch your IntelliJ IDEA for the first time, you will see the Import Settings dialog with the list of other IDE's settings found on your machine.

  1. Select from which IDE you want to import settings.

If you use several JetBrains IDEs, select the one with the preferred settings from the drop-down list or click Other Options to select IDEs used more than 6 months ago.
