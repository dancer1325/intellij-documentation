## Navigation

IntelliJ IDEA lets you quickly jump from the source code to the related test file with the Go to test action (`Ctrl+Shift+T` or Navigate | Test). For example, from auth.js you can jump to auth.test.js.

You can also quickly navigate through a test file using the Structure view that shows the names of the tests and suites, as well as other symbols defined in this file.

To jump to the Structure tool window, press `Alt+7`. Alternatively, press `Ctrl+F12` to open the Structure view as a popup in the editor.
