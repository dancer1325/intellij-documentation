# Speed Search in tool windows

Speed Search helps you quickly find an item in a tool window: a file or a folder in the Project tool window `Alt+1`, a member in the Structure tool window, a changelist in the Commit tool window `Alt+0`, an item in the TODO list, and so on.

  1. Select a tool window, a tree, a list, or a popup.

  2. Start typing the item name, for example, the name of a file, class, or field. As you type, a field appears over the tool window showing the entered characters, and the selection moves to the first item that matches the specified string. The matching part of the string is highlighted. 

You can use the Speed Search feature as a shortcut. Press `Ctrl+F`.

For the Database tool window, a Speed Search filter is also available.

  4. If several items match the pattern, use the `Up` and `Down` keys to move between them. Press `Enter` to open the selected item. Press `Escape` to hide the search field.




Speed Search works only for expanded nodes. It will not highlight matching items in collapsed nodes.
