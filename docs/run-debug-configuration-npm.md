## Before you start

  1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download). Note that npm is also installed so if you are going to use it, you are through with the preliminary steps.

  2. To use Yarn, install it as described on the [Yarn official website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
