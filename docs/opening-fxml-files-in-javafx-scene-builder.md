## Open files in Scene Builder in the IDE

When you open an .fxml file in the editor, there are two tabs underneath the editing area: the Text tab is for developing the markup, and the Scene Builder tab is for editing the file in Scene Builder.

  1. Open an .fxml file in the editor.

  2. Switch to the Scene Builder tab.

  3. If your project doesn't have JavaFX Scene Builder, you will see a notification panel prompting you to install Scene Builder Kit.

Click Download Scene Builder Kit on the panel.

After that you can view .fxml files in Scene Builder right in the IDE by switching to the dedicated tab.

Learn how to use JavaFX Scene Builder from [JavaFX Scene Builder: User Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/scene-builder-2/user-guide/index.html) on the Oracle website.
