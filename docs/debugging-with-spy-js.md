# Profiling JavaScript with Spy-js

Support for tracing code execution and debugging applications with Spy-js is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [Spy-js](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7417-spy-js) plugin from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for Spy-js in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2022.2/debugging-with-spy-js.html).
