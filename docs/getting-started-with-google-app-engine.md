# Getting started with Google App Engine

Support for creating [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) projects and uploading your applications to Google infrastructure is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA.

The plugin is no longer supported, so we recommend that you migrate to the [Cloud Code](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/migrate) plugin.

If necessary, you can install the [Google App Engine](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4254-google-app-engine) plugin from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html). Note that the latest IDE version supported by the plugin is 2022.2.4.

You can find the documentation for Google App Engine in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2022.2/getting-started-with-google-app-engine.html).
