## Wrapping and Braces

Configure the options for breaking lines.

Hard wrap at| Specify at which column to put a line break. IntelliJ IDEA shows a vertical line at the specified column and breaks lines between words, not within words.  
---|---  
Wrap on typing| Add line breaks as you type. Disable this option to add line breaks only when IntelliJ IDEA performs [reformatting](reformat-and-rearrange-code.html).  
Wrap long text| Enable hard wrapping.  
Wrap text inside block quotes| Enable hard wrapping for block quotes.  
Visual guides| Show an additional vertical line at the specified column.  
When reformatting| Configure additional actions to perform during [reformatting](reformat-and-rearrange-code.html).

  * Keep line breaks inside text blocks: Do not remove line breaks within paragraphs.
  * Insert block quote arrows: Add the block quote marker (the "greater than" character `>`) at the beginning of each line in a block quote.
  * Format tables: Reformat tables to align all the cells and properly fit all the content. For information about reformatting tables as you type, see [Smart Keys: Markdown](settings-smart-keys-markdown.html).
