## Work with data

To learn how to work with column data, refer to the topics of [Data editor and viewer](data-editor-and-viewer.html) section:

  1. [Sort data](tables-sort.html)

You can sort data by clicking a column's header, or by entering a sorting query into the corresponding field. By default, each time you sort data, IntelliJ IDEA sends a new `ORDER BY` query to the database. You can also change the setting and sort data on the client side.

  2. [Filter data](tables-filter.html)

Use one of the following ways to filter data:

     * Specify filtering conditions.

     * Run a search on the table.

     * Enter a filtering query into the corresponding field.
