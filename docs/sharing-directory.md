# Share directory

IntelliJ IDEA supports the Subversion sharing directories feature. The Share Directory command is applied to the content roots. When such content root is shared, a new directory is created in the specified location of the Subversion repository, checked out to the local directory you want to share, and the contents of the local directory are added to the repository. As a result, the local directory contains a valid working copy of the repository.

To share a directory via the Subversion repository, do the following:

  1. In the [Project tool window](project-tool-window.html), select an unversioned directory that is the content root of a module associated with Subversion.

  2. Go to VCS | Subversion | Share Directory.

  3. Specify the target repository location where to share the directory.
