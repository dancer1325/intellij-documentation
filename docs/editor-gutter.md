## Line numbers

By default, the gutter displays line numbers, which makes it easier to reference specific lines of code when discussing with teammates or navigating through code.

### Configure line numbers

You can switch between several line numbering modes according to your needs.

  1. Open the Settings dialog (`Ctrl+Alt+S`) and go to Editor | General | Appearance.

  2. With the Show line numbers option enabled, select the required line numbering mode from the drop-down menu:

The standard line numbering that runs sequentially from the top of the file to the bottom, giving each line a unique number. This mode is helpful for direct navigation and referencing specific lines in discussions or error messages.

The line number shows how many lines away each line is from the current position of the caret. This is particularly useful for quickly moving or editing code blocks using [keyboard shortcuts](mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html).

![Relative line numbering](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/ij_line_numbering_relative.png)

This mode combines absolute and relative line numbering, showing the absolute line number at the caret's current position and relative numbers on all other lines. It allows using the benefits of both systems for efficient navigation and editing.

To hide line numbers, do one of the following:

  * In the Settings dialog, go to Editor | General | Appearance and uncheck the Show line numbers option.
