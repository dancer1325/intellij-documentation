## Return to a previous stack frame

IntelliJ IDEA lets you fall back to a previous stack frame in a program's execution flow. This can be useful, for example, if you've mistakenly stepped too far and want to re-enter a method where you missed a critical spot.

  * In the Threads tab, hover over the frame you want to reset, then click the Reset Frame button that appears.

Reset Frame only resets local variables. It does not revert changes to the application's global state.
