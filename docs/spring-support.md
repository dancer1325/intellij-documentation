# Spring

[Spring](https://spring.io/) is an application framework for the Java platform. It helps you build modern web applications with support for microservice architectures, cloud systems, reactive processing, and serverless workloads.

IntelliJ IDEA provides extensive coding assistance for Spring, including a dedicated project wizard, code highlighting, debugger, intelligent context actions, embedded documentation, navigation, and highly customizable run configurations. For a detailed description of the supported features, refer to [IntelliJ IDEA for Spring Developers](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/spring/).

### Enable Spring support in IntelliJ IDEA

Spring support relies on the Spring and related plugins, which are bundled and enabled by default in IntelliJ IDEA with the Ultimate subscription.

Spring support is limited in IntelliJ IDEA without the Ultimate subscription.

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Installed tab, search for Spring and make sure that the checkboxes next to all relevant plugins are selected.
