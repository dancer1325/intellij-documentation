# Settings Repository

The Settings Repository plugin is deprecated and not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. It is still available for installation in JetBrains Marketplace. You can find the documentation for Settings Repository in the [earlier version of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2022.2/sharing-your-ide-settings.html).

The recommended way to share IDE settings in the current IntelliJ IDEA version is to [use the Backup and Sync plugin](sharing-your-ide-settings.html#IDE_settings_sync).
