## Edit a commit message

If the only thing you need to change is a commit message, you can edit it before you push this commit.

  1. Right-click the commit whose message you want to edit in the Log tab of the Git tool window `Alt+9` and select Edit Commit Message from the context menu, or press `F2`.

  2. In the dialog that opens, enter a new commit message and click OK.
