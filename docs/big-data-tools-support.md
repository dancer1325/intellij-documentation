# Big Data Tools

The Big Data Tools is a [set of plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/bundles/8-big-data-tools) intended for data engineers.

It includes the following plugins:

Spark
    

[Submit](big-data-tools-spark.html) and monitor Spark jobs

Flink
    

[Monitor Flink jobs](big-data-tools-flink.html)

Kafka
    

[Connect](big-data-tools-kafka.html) to Kafka brokers and Kafka Schema Registry, produce and consume data

Remote File Systems
    

[Access remote storages](big-data-tools-remote-file-systems.html)

Big Data File Viewer
    

Preview Parquet, ORC, Avro, and CSV files (the plugin is installed automatically with the Remote File Systems plugin)

Zeppelin
    

Connect to Zeppelin, run code in notebooks, and preview output (development of the Zeppelin plugin is currently suspended)

Before IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2, Big Data Tools was a single plugin, and none of its parts could be installed separately. Starting from 2023.2, you can install any of these tools as a separate plugin. You can also install the Big Data Tools plugin, which will automatically install all these six plugins.

If you used Big Data Tools in 2023.1 or before, then after updating IntelliJ IDEA to 2023.3, you will have all these new plugins automatically installed.
