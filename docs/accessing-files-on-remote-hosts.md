  2. Select the required deployment server from the list. The tool window shows a tree view of files and folders under the server root. If no relevant server is available in the list, click ![the Browse button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.general.ellipsis.svg), and in the Deployment dialog that opens [configure access to the required server](configuring-synchronization-with-a-remote-host.html).
