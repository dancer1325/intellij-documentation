# Seam

Support for developing web applications based on the [JBoss Seam framework](http://www.seamframework.org/) is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA. You can install the [JBoss Seam plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14587-jboss-seam) from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation for Seam in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2020.1/seam.html).
