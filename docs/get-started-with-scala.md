## Install the Scala plugin

If you already installed IntelliJ IDEA, and now you want to add Scala support to it, you need to download and enable the Scala plugin. If you run IntelliJ IDEA for the first time, you can install the Scala plugin when IntelliJ IDEA suggests downloading featured plugins. Otherwise, you can download the plugin manually.

### Install the Scala plugin

This functionality relies on the [Scala](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala) plugin, which you need to install and enable. 

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Marketplace tab, find the Scala plugin, and click Install (restart the IDE if prompted).

Now you can create a new Scala project, import one from existing sources, or check it out from VCS.
