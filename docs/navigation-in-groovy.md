## Recent files

Most of the time you work with a finite set of files, and need to switch between them quickly. A real time-saver here is an action called Recent Files invoked by pressing `Ctrl+E`. By default, the focus is on the last accessed file. Note that you can also open any tool window through this action:

Navigate to Class is available by pressing `Ctrl+N` and supports sophisticated expressions, including camel humps, paths, line navigate to, middle name matching, and many more. If you call it twice, it shows you the results out of the project classes.

Navigate to File works similarly by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+N`, but is used for files and folders. To navigate to a folder, end your expression with the `Slash` character.

Navigate to Symbol is available by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N` and allows you to find a method or a field by its name.

Recent Locations popup lets you check recently visited or changed code locations and is available by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+E`.
