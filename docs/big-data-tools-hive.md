## Monitor databases

Once you have established a connection to the Hive server, the Hive Metastore tool window becomes available. You can use it to monitor your databases, view schemas and partitions, and configure the way the data is displayed:

  * Start typing a name in the Filter field to filter databases by name.

  * Click ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.general.filter.svg) to filter data by storage type.

  * Click ![Show and hide column icon](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/bigdatatools-core.icons.table.configureColumns.svg) to show or hide columns from the database view.

In the Location column, you can click the database URL to quickly open a directory in an HDFS or S3 viewer. If the needed connection does not exist, this will open the connection creation form.
