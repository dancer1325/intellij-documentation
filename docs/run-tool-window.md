## Tool window tabs

### Pin tabs

If you are running multiple applications, each one is displayed in a tab named after the [run/debug configuration](run-debug-configuration.html) applied. To preserve the output of an application, even if you re-run it, pin the output tab.

  * Right-click the tab and select Pin Tab.

To pin tabs by default, press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open the IDE settings, select Advanced Settings and enable the Make configurations pinned by default option.
