# Logs tab

The Logs tab is available if [logging](setting-log-options.html) has been activated in the current [run/debug configuration](run-debug-configuration.html). The log tab is named after the log file.

If there are multiple log files enabled for a run/debug configuration, the tab name is composed of all the log file names delimited with the "|" characters. In this case, each log is displayed in its own tab. 

### Configure tab titles

  * In the [Logs section](setting-log-options.html) of the corresponding [run/debug configuration](run-debug-configuration.html), change the Tab Name to the preferred name.




### Search in logs

  * In the toolbar of the Run or Debug tool window, specify the message severity and content to search.
