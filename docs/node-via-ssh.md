## Before you start

  1. Make sure the JavaScript and TypeScript, JavaScript Debugger, Node.js, Node.js Remote Interpreter, and FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity required plugins are enabled on the Settings | Plugins page, tab Installed. For more information, refer to [Managing plugins](managing-plugins.html). 

  2. Configure access to an SSH server on the target remote host as described in [Create SSH configurations](create-ssh-configurations.html) and make sure this server is running.

  3. Make sure your project sources are on the target remote host. This can be done in the following two ways:

     * Upload your project sources to the target remote host as described in [Upload and download files](uploading-and-downloading-files.html).

     * Enable a network share on your local machine and mount your project folder in the target directory on the remote host.

The way you share files and folders depends on the operating system you are using. For more information, refer to your OS instructions.
