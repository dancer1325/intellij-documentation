## Before you start

### Enable the XPathView + XSLT plugin

This functionality relies on the [XPathView + XSLT](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12478-xpathview--xslt) plugin, which is bundled and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA by default. If the relevant features are not available, make sure that you did not disable the plugin. 

The XPathView + XSLT plugin is available by default only in IntelliJ IDEA with the Ultimate subscription. For IntelliJ IDEA, you need to install the XPathView + XSLT plugin as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Installed tab, find the XPathView + XSLT plugin, and select the checkbox next to the plugin name.
