## Check prerequisites

For this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

  * You are familiar with the IDE and have the [latest stable version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). We will use IntelliJ IDEA version 2025.1 in this tutorial.

  * By default, you have the Maven plugin [installed](managing-plugins.html) and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA. If it is not, check the IDE [settings](settings-required-plugins.html). 

![The Plugins settings dialog](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/settings_maven_plugins.png)
  * You have an existing Java project and can open it inside the IDE.

If you do not have a project handy, you can use [our sample project](https://github.com/JetBrains/MortgageCalculator) or complete the [Create your first Java application](creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html) tutorial to create your own Java sample project.

  * In this tutorial, we will use the bundled Maven version 3.9 and the default project JDK version 21.0.1. If you're using your own project instead of the example, ensure you have compatible versions of Maven and the JDK.
