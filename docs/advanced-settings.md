## Bookmarks

Item| Description  
---|---  
Show only line bookmarks in popup| By default, IntelliJ IDEA shows only line bookmarks in the bookmarks popup (`Shift+F11` or Edit | Bookmarks | Show Line Bookmarks). Disable this option if you want to see other bookmarked items in the popup, for example, files or folders. For more information, refer to [Bookmarks](bookmarks.html).
