# Filter out extraneous changelists

With the extended [Merge Info](version-control-tool-window-repository-and-incoming-tabs.html#mergeInfo) functionality, you can limit the number of changelists displayed in the Changelists pane by applying the following filters:

Filtering out integrated/not integrated changelists is available only when integration status is highlighted.

Otherwise the Filter out integrated button ![filterOutIntegrated.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/filterOutIntegrated.png) and Filter out not integrated button ![filterOutNotIntegrated.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/filterOutNotIntegrated.png) are disabled. To enable integration status highlighting, click the Highlight Integrated button ![highlightIntegrated.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/highlightIntegrated.png) on the toolbar.

  * To display only the changelists that have not been integrated into the working copy, click the Filter out integrated button ![filterOutIntegrated.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/filterOutIntegrated.png) on the toolbar.

  * To display only the changelists that have been integrated into the working copy, click the Filter out not integrated button ![filterOutNotIntegrated.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/filterOutNotIntegrated.png) on the toolbar.

  * To hide the changelists that are managed in another VCS or are located under another root, click the Filter out others button ![filterOutOthers.png](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/filterOutOthers.png) on the toolbar.

  * To display only the changelists that were committed by a specific user, select User in the Filter by drop-down list. Then select the required user name.

  * To display only the changelists applied to a specific module or folder, select Structure in the Filter by drop-down list. Then select the required location.

  * To group changelists by users who committed them, or by commit dates, select the corresponding option in the Group by drop-down list.
