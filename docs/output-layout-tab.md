## Reordering the items

The order of items is important when there are elements that lead to producing files with the same name in the same directory. In such situations, only the file from the element that comes first will be included in the artifact.

To see the actual order of items, release ![the Sort Alphabetically button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.objectBrowser.sorted.svg). Then use ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.general.up.svg) or ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.general.down.svg) to reorder the items.
