# Monitor SOAP messages

While testing the client side of an Apache Axis Web service, it may be helpful to view related SOAP messages which provide procedure details.

Make sure the target Web service application is running.

### To enable monitoring SOAP messages

  1. In the main menu, go to Tools | XML WebServices and WSDL | Monitor SOAP Messages.

  2. In the [Monitor SOAP Messages](monitor-soap-messages-dialog.html) dialog that opens, specify the Web context of the target application and the port to listen to.
