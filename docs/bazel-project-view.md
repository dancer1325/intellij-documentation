## Project view configuration

The project view is configured in a .bazelproject file. You might have several such files located anywhere in your project. For information on .bazelproject file syntax, refer to the [.bazelproject file reference](#bazelproject_reference) chapter.

If your teammates are working on the same subset of the project, you can create a .bazelproject file and [share it through VCS](version-control-integration.html). This will ensure a consistent view of the project for everyone.
