When you work with Java modules, keep the following in mind:

  * IntelliJ IDEA allows only one Java module per one IntelliJ IDEA module.

  * You can create a diagram for the JDK module as well. For example, right-click the java.jnlp file and from the context menu select Java Modules Diagram.

  * You can open the module-info.java file in the editor and from the context menu also create a diagram.
