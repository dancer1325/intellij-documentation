## Manage incoming pull requests

If you are a project maintainer, and you have a GitHub remote configured for your project, you can view and manage incoming pull requests directly from IntelliJ IDEA.

To open the Pull Requests tool window, select Git | GitHub | View Pull Requests in the main menu.

In the Pull Requests tool window, you can:

  * Filter requests by state, author, label, assignee, and review status.

  * Sort pull requests by their activity status: newest, oldest, most or least commented, recently or least recently updated.

  * Jump to a pull request on GitHub: select a pull request and choose Open Pull Request in Browser from the context menu.




When you double-click a pull request from the list, you can see the overview and timeline tabs.

In this view, you can:

  * View the timeline of a selected pull request to track its progression.

  * Select a particular commit to filter the list of changes.

  * Create a local branch based on incoming changes: open a pull request, click the branch with incoming changes, and choose Checkout 'branch name' in the context menu. 




To learn about more options, refer to [Review a pull request](#provide-feedback).

To make sure you always have the latest information about the pull requests, press `Ctrl+F5`. Alternatively, right-click the list of pull requests and select Refresh List.
