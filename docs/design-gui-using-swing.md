## Sections of a form

Before we proceed, let us take a quick look at BookEditor.form. When you select a .form file, you will have a view of the UI Designer which consists of four main sections.

  1. **[Form workspace](form-workspace.html)** : shows a visual representation of the components in your form. The top-level JPanel component is added by default when you create a new GUI form in IntelliJ IDEA, and you can add more components to build out your form.

  2. **[Component Tree](components-treeview.html)** : shows the components contained in the design form and enables you to navigate and select one or more components. Our form currently only has one component, JPanel, however we will soon add more components.

  3. **[Property inspector](inspector.html)** : shows properties for the component currently selected in the form workspace or the Component Tree.

  4. **[Palette](palette.html)** : contains a list of UI components you can place in a form.
