## Generate a DTD for an XML file

  1. Open the file in the editor.

  2. In the main menu, go to Tools | XML Actions | Generate DTD From XML File. IntelliJ IDEA inserts the resulting DTD as a section above the first line of the file.




If the Generate DTD From XML File action is disabled, make sure that the XML file is not [marked as plain text](content-roots.html#exclude-files) and is not in an [excluded directory](content-roots.html).
