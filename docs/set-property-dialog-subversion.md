# Set Property dialog (Subversion)

Use this dialog to define SVN-specific properties for the files and folders under SVN version control (the ignore list, externals, and so on)

Item| Description  
---|---  
Property name| Enter custom property name in the text field, or use the drop-down list to select one of the pre-defined properties.  
Set property value| Click this radio-button to set value for the specified property name in the text area. Properties that accept multiple values, such as an ignore list, can be entered on multiple lines.  
Delete property| Click this radio-button to remove selected property from the list.  
Update properties recursively| Check this option, if you want to apply the property to every file and directory under the selected directory.
