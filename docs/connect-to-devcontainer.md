## Scenarios for creating Dev Containers

In IntelliJ IDEA, there are various scenarios that you can use to start a Dev Container:

  * From an opened project inside the IDE. For more information, refer to [Start Dev Container inside IDE](start-dev-container-inside-ide.html).

  * From the IDE Welcome screen. For more information, refer to [Start Dev Container from the IDE welcome screen](start-dev-container-from-welcome-screen.html).

  * From a remote server. For more information, refer to [Start Dev Container for a remote project](start-dev-container-for-a-remote-project.html).




Before starting to work with Dev Containers, make sure you have read [Prerequisites](prerequisites-for-dev-containers.html) and [limitations](dev-container-limitations.html).

You can use [the sample project](https://github.com/IdeaUJetBrains/idea-demo-devcontainers.git) to quickly check the process of creating a Dev Container.
