# Cucumber

Support for testing applications with the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework is not bundled with IntelliJ IDEA.

You can install the [Cucumber for Java](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java), [Cucumber for Groovy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7213-cucumber-for-groovy), and [Gherkin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9164-gherkin) plugins from JetBrains Marketplace as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).

You can find the documentation about Cucumber support in [earlier versions of IntelliJ IDEA Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2023.3/cucumber-support.html).
