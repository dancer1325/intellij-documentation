## Quick documentation

The [quick documentation](viewing-reference-information.html#inline-quick-documentation) provides details about values in the selected cell or cells. For example, if a cell contains a long text, you will see the whole text. Also, you can see records that are referenced in the current record as well as the records that reference the current one.
