# TextMate Bundles

Use this page to import the [TextMate/SublimeText 2 bundles](http://manual.macromates.com/en/bundles#bundles), and to map the color scheme of IntelliJ IDEA to that of TextMate.

### Enable the TextMate Bundles plugin

This functionality relies on the [TextMate Bundles](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7221) plugin, which is bundled and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA by default. If the relevant features are not available, make sure that you did not disable the plugin. 

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Installed tab, find the TextMate Bundles plugin, and select the checkbox next to the plugin name.
