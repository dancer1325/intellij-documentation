## Run Docker containers before another run configuration

You can set any Docker run configuration as a [Before launch](run-debug-configurations-dialog.html#before-launch-options) task for another run configuration. For example, if your application relies on a running database, you can automatically run a Docker container with the database every time you run your application from sources.
