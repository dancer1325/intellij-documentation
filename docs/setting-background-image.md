## Background image settings

The Background Image dialog has the following options:

Image| Either specify a local path to an image in your file system or a URL to an image on a remote server.  
---|---  
Opacity| Specify the relative opacity of the image, where 100 is completely opaque and 0 is completely transparent.  
Placement options| Use the icons to select where to place the image:

  * Mirror the image vertically or horizontally
  * Select whether to place one copy of the image at its original size, scale the image to fit the entire width, or fill the entire width with copies of the image at its original size
  * If you choose to keep the original size, select where to put the image: in the center, on a side, or in a corner.

  
This project only| Select if you want to use this custom image as a background only in the current project.  
Editor and Tools| Configure an image to be used as the background of the editor and tool windows.  
Empty Frame| Configure an image to be used as the background when no files are open in the editor.  
Clear and Close| Clear the background image and use the default background.
