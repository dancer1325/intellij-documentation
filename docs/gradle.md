## Configure Gradle Daemon toolchains

Starting with Gradle version 8.8, IntelliJ IDEA supports the Gradle Daemon toolchain, which helps speed up builds and manage project JDKs. Also, starting with IntelliJ IDEA version 2025.1, this support is available by default.

You can either create a new project with the daemon toolchain or add the support to the already existing project.
