# Presentation Assistant

Presentation Assistant is a useful tool to help you present code or demonstrate software features. As you invoke actions, Presentation Assistant displays their names and shortcuts in a popup. This helps your audience understand what you are doing without confusion.

### Enable Presentation Assistant

Your IDE already includes Presentation Assistant, which is disabled by default.

  1. In the main menu, go to View | Appearance and enable Presentation Assistant.

  2. Start working as usual. Presentation Assistant now displays names of actions that you invoke and their shortcuts.

### Change the popup appearance

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Appearance & Behavior | Presentation Assistant. 

Alternatively, hover over the popup, click ![](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.actions.more.svg) and click Settings.

  2. Configure the options:

     * Popup size: choose how big you want the popup to be.

     * Display for: set for how long the popup should be shown.

     * Position: decide where to position the popup. You can also move the popup by dragging it.

### Configure the keymap

Presentation Assistant shows shortcuts from the keymap that correspond to your operating system by default. You can change the main keymap and add a secondary one.

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Appearance & Behavior | Presentation Assistant.

  2. In the Keymap section, select another keymap from the Main list. Optionally, specify a different keymap label.

  3. To add a secondary keymap, enable the Additional option and select a keymap from the list.
