## Building a module dependency diagram

  * Choose Diagrams | Show Diagram from the context menu of a JavaScript, TypeScript, or HTML file or from the context menu of a folder.

The action is not available for node_modules and for `Excluded` folders.

If the action is invoked on a folder where multiple types of diagrams can be built, additionally choose JavaScript Module Dependency Diagram from the Select Diagram Type list.
