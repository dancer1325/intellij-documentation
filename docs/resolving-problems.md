## Apply fixes in the Problems tool window

If you have invoked inspections manually, you can examine the results in the Problems tool window that opens automatically after the analysis is finished. All detected problems are listed in the left part of the tool window. Click a problem to display inspection details on the right.

  * To fix a problem, click the ![the Intention action button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.codeInsight.intentionBulb.png) icon on the toolbar or in the context menu. You can also press `Alt+Enter` and select a suitable fix from the popup menu.

  * If a problem occurs several times in a file, you can fix all the occurrences at once. Select the problem description, click ![the Intention action button](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app.expui.codeInsight.intentionBulb.png) icon on the toolbar, select the relevant fix, and then select Fix all "<problem description>" in file from the list.
