## Choose the right keymap

To view the keymap configuration, open the Settings dialog `Ctrl+Alt+S` and select Keymap.

Enable function keys and check for [possible conflicts](configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html#conflicts) with global OS shortcuts.

### Use a predefined keymap

IntelliJ IDEA automatically suggests a predefined keymap based on your environment. Make sure that it matches the OS you are using or select the one that matches shortcuts from another IDE or editor you are used to (for example, Eclipse or NetBeans).

When consulting this page and other pages in IntelliJ IDEA documentation, you can see keyboard shortcuts for the keymap that you use in the IDE — choose it using the selector at the top of a page.

### Install a keymap from a plugin

Besides the default set of keymaps, you can install keymaps from plugins (such as, keymaps for GNOME and KDE): open the Settings dialog `Ctrl+Alt+S`, select Plugins, switch to the Marketplace tab and search for keymap.

### Tune your keymap

You can modify a copy of any predefined keymap to [assign your own shortcuts](configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html#add-keyboard-shortcut) for commands that you use frequently.

### Import custom keymap

If you have a customized keymap that you are used to, you can [transfer it to your installation](configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html#custom_keymap_location).

If your keymap stopped working after an update, it is likely that the keymap is not available by default in the new version of IntelliJ IDEA. Find this keymap as a plugin and install it on the [Plugins page](plugins-settings.html) as described in [Install plugins](managing-plugins.html).
