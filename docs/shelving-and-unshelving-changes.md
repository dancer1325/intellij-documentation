## Shelve vs Stash

Stashing changes is very similar to shelving.

  * [Stashes](#stash) are generated by Git, and can be applied from within IntelliJ IDEA, or outside it.

  * Patches with [shelved](#shelve-unshelve-changes) changes are generated by IntelliJ IDEA and are also applied through the IDE.




Also, [stashing](#stash) involves all uncommitted changes, while when you [shelve](#shelve-unshelve-changes) changes, you can select some of the local changes instead of shelving them all.

### Combine Stash and Shelf tabs

If you want to work both with [stashes](#stash) and [shelves](#shelve-unshelve-changes), you can combine the Stash and the Shelf tabs into one.

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and select Version Control | Git | Stash. 

  2. Enable the Combine stashes and shelves in one tab option.

In the combined tab, you will be able to work both with [stashed](#stash) and [shelved](#shelve-unshelve-changes) changes.
