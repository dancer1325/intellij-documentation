## Notification balloons

Balloon notifications show up in the bottom right corner of the IDE and inform you about important events and suggestions.

If you prefer to work without distractions, you can disable all balloon notifications at once.

### Disable all balloon notifications

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Appearance & Behavior | Notifications.

  2. Disable the Display balloon notifications option.




You can also configure or completely disable balloon notifications for specific event groups using the [Popup type](#popup_type) list.
