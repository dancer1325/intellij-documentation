## Breadcrumbs vs. the navigation bar

Breadcrumbs are similar to the [navigation bar](guided-tour-around-the-user-interface.html#navigation-bar), which also helps you navigate your code.

The difference is that breadcrumbs let you navigate the structure of the current file, while the navigation bar allows you to explore the structure of the project and access context menus for items, just like in the Project tool window.
