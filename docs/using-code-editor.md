## Navigation

You can use various shortcuts to switch between the editor and different tool windows, change the editor size, switch focus, or return to the original layout.

### Maximize editor pane

  * In the editor, press `Ctrl+Shift+F12`. IntelliJ IDEA hides all windows except the active editor.

You can maximize a split screen as well. In this case, the active screen is maximized, and other screens are moved aside.




### Switch the focus from a window to the editor

  * Press `Escape`. IntelliJ IDEA moves the focus from any window to the active editor.




### Return to the editor from the command-line terminal

This functionality relies on the [Terminal](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13123-terminal) plugin, which you need to install and enable. For more information, refer to [Install a plugin from Marketplace](managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_repo). 

  * Press `Alt+F12`. IntelliJ IDEA closes the terminal window.

  * If you need to keep the terminal window open when you switch back to the active editor, press `Ctrl+Tab`.




### Jump to the last active window

  * Press `F12`.




### Use the switcher for navigation

  1. To jump between the opened files and tool windows with the switcher, press `Ctrl+Tab`.

  2. Keep `Ctrl` pressed to leave the switcher popup open.

  3. Press `Tab` to move between elements. Press `Backspace` to remove the selected file from the list and close it in the editor.




### Change the IDE appearance

You can switch between schemes, keymaps, and viewing modes.

  1. Press `Ctrl+``.

  2. In the Switch menu, select the option you need and press `Enter`. Use the same shortcut `Ctrl+`` to undo your changes.




You can adjust the color scheme settings, including the High contrast color scheme for people with eyesight deficiency, in Settings | Editor | Color Scheme. To adjust the keymap settings, go to Settings | Keymap.

### Jump to the navigation bar

  * Press `Alt+Home`.
