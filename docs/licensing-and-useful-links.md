## Licensing

JetBrains Gateway itself is a free application. To use remote development, you will need a license for the remote IDE.

If you have certain setup scenarios based on company's security regulations, check the [licensing changes](#licensing_changes), and reach out to us for more information.

The licensing for Remote Development is handled on the local machine and is covered by your existing active IDE license.

No license information is passed to or saved on the remote server. You can start the IDE backend without entering the license information since JetBrains Gateway is a free application.

The license will be checked later when you connect to the launched IDE backend. Product in the license on your local machine must match the remote backend IDE. If you use a corporate floating license server, that's your local (client) machine, which must be able to reach this server. In this context nothing is changed from the same local IntelliJ IDEA [mechanism](register.html).
