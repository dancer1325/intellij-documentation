## Build Output tab

IntelliJ IDEA displays the result of your build in the Build Output tab. Depending on a project, the build output shows tasks, goals, and commands that were executed and error messages that were produced.

By default, the tab also displays all successful steps and warnings.

### Build a project

  1. In the main menu, go to Build | Build Project or press `Ctrl+F9`.

  2. Check the results in the Build tool window.

If the tool window does not open automatically, go to View | Tool Windows | Build in the main menu.
