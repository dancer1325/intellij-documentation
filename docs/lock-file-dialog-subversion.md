# Lock File dialog (Subversion)

Use this dialog to lock file when it is necessary to avoid overwriting changes.

Item| Description  
---|---  
Lock Comment| In this field, describe the reason for locking the file and some additional comments, if necessary.  
Steal existing lock| Select this checkbox to override the lock previously set on the desired file by someone else.  
Do not show this dialog in the future| Select this checkbox to suppress displaying this dialog and have files and folders locked silently. To have IntelliJ IDEA show this dialog before locking files or folders again:

  1. Open the [Version Control - Confirmation](settings-version-control-confirmation.html) page of the [Settings](settings-preferences-dialog.html) dialog.
  2. In the Display Option dialogs when these commands are invoked area, select the Checkout checkbox.
