## Manage application artifacts

To manage your artifact configurations, use the Project Structure dialog (File | Project Structure | Artifacts).

To deploy your application to a server, you need an application [artifact](working-with-artifacts.html). For Java web applications, IntelliJ IDEA provides the following artifact formats:

  * Web Application: Exploded. This is a decompressed Web application archive ([WAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_\(file_format\))), a directory structure that is ready for deployment onto a web server.

  * Web Application: Archive. This is a WAR file.




For more information, refer to [Artifacts](working-with-artifacts.html).
