## Check project files status

IntelliJ IDEA allows you to check the status of your local working copy compared to the repository version of the project. It lets you see which files have been modified, which new files have been added to Git, and which files are not being tracked by Git.

Open the Commit tool window `Alt+0`. 

![Git file status](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/Git_file_status.png)

  * The Changes changelist shows all files that have been modified since you last synchronized with the remote repository (highlighted in blue), and all new files that have been added to Git, but have not been committed yet (highlighted in green).

  * The Unversioned Files changelist shows all files that have been added to your project, but that are not being tracked by Git.




If you want ignored files to be also displayed in the Commit window, click ![View Opions](https://resources.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2025.3/app-client.expui.general.show.svg) on the toolbar and select Show Ignored Files.
