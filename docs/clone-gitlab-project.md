## Clone a GitLab project

You can clone [a GitLab project](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/) that you want to contribute to directly from IntelliJ IDEA and create a new project based on it.

Before cloning a project, make sure you have [logged in](set-up-a-gitlab-account.html#log-in-to-gitlab) to your GitLab account.

  1. Use one of the options to open the Clone Repository dialog:

     * Go to File | New | Project from Version Control.

     * If you already have a project open, go to VCS | Get from Version Control.

     * On the Welcome screen, click the Clone Repository button.

  2. Specify the URL of the project you want to clone.

  3. In the Directory field, enter the path to the folder where your local Git project will be created.

  4. Click Clone.
