## Interactive scratch files in K2 mode

In [Kotlin K2 mode](get-started-with-kotlin.html#kotlin_k2_mode), scratch files support an Interactive mode. This feature allows you to see results instantly as you type and modify code, enabling a faster and more efficient feedback loop during experimentation and prototyping. You can leverage this mode directly in the scratch file editor without needing to compile or explicitly run the code.
