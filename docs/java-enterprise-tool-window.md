# Java Enterprise tool window

The Java Enterprise tool window is no longer available in IntelliJ IDEA.

You can use the [Beans tool window](beans-tool-window.html) to view the Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) beans detected in your project and use the [Endpoints tool window](endpoints-tool-window.html) to view endpoints, generate HTTP requests, and create OpenAPI specifications.
