## Move refactorings

Besides [moving files and folders](refactoring-source-code.html), IntelliJ IDEA lets you move TypeScript top-level symbols. The Move Symbol Refactoring works for classes, functions, and variables in ES6 modules.

### Move a class, a function, or a variable

  1. Select the symbol to move.

  2. Press `F6` or select Refactor | Move from the main menu or from the context menu of the selection. Alternatively, choose Refactor | Refactor This or press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T`, then choose Move from the list.

The Move Module Members dialog opens.

  3. Specify the destination file and select the members to move.

  4. By default, IntelliJ IDEA automatically raises the visibility of the members to the required level. If you want to keep the visibility level unchanged, click As is in the Visibility.
