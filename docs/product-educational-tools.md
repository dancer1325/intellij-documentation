# IntelliJ IDEA for Education

IntelliJ IDEA can be used for learning and teaching programming. You can learn Java, Kotlin, and Scala from scratch or perfect your skills in these languages with interactive courses and programming contests. If you are interested in creating your own courses, you can do it right in IntelliJ IDEA as well.

### Start the learning course

  1. Download [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to use it for your educational purposes right away. If you need further instructions, refer to the [installation guide](installation-guide.html).

  2. On the Welcome screen, click Learn in the left pane.

  3. In the right pane, click Enable Access under Learn to program and then Get Started.
