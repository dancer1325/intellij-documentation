## Clone a project

First of all, we need to clone the repository containing the sample application:

  1. Run IntelliJ IDEA and click Clone Repository on the Welcome Screen.

     * Make sure that Git is selected in the Version control field.

     * Insert the following address in the URL field:

https://github.com/JetBrains/sample_rails_app_7th_ed.git

Click the Clone button. IntelliJ IDEA will show a progress bar indicating a cloning process.

  3. After cloning the repository, IntelliJ IDEA opens the project and starts the indexing process. You can see the progress in the Status Bar.

IntelliJ IDEA indexes your project to analyze its sources and collects the information on available files, class and method definitions, and so on. This is required for code insight features such as [code completion](#edit) and [navigation](#navigate).

Indexing occurs when you open a project for the first time, install dependencies, add new files to a project, get updates from a version control system, or switch branches.
