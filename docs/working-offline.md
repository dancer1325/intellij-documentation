## Updates

By default, IntelliJ IDEA is configured to check for updates automatically and notify you when a new version is available. Updates are usually patch-based: they are applied to the existing installation and only require you to restart the IDE. However, sometimes patch updates are not available, and a new version of IntelliJ IDEA must be installed. 

If IntelliJ IDEA does not have HTTP access outside your local network, it will not be able to check for updates and apply patches. In this case, you have to download new versions of the IDE and install them manually as described in [Standalone installation](installation-guide.html#standalone).

Without internet access, you can't install IntelliJ IDEA using the [Toolbox App](installation-guide.html#toolbox) and [snaps](installation-guide.html#snap).

For more information, refer to [Update IntelliJ IDEA](update.html).
