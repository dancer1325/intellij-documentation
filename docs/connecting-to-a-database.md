## Data source

To connect to a database, IntelliJ IDEA requires connection details (for example, host, port, password, SSH configuration settings, and so on). For every database, the connection details are stored in a dedicated connection configuration — [data source](managing-data-sources.html).

Below is an example of the `PostgreSQL` data source settings in the Data Sources and Drivers dialog ( `Shift+Enter`) . For information about dialog fields, refer to [the dialog reference topic](data-sources-and-drivers-dialog.html) and [data source creation instructions](managing-data-sources.html#create_a_data_source).
