# Mark Resolved dialog (Subversion)

Use this dialog to have IntelliJ IDEA consider conflicts in a file or directory resolved. This operation is most often required after merging text or property conflicts manually.

Item| Description  
---|---  
Files and directories| The list shows all the files and directories where merge or updated resulted in conflicts that IntelliJ IDEA cannot resolve automatically. When you have examined the conflicts, resolved them manually, or considered irrelevant, you need to tell IntelliJ IDEA that these files are no longer conflicting. To appoint a file for marking as free from conflicts, select the checkbox next to it.  
Select All| Click this button to have all the items in the list appointed for marking as resolved.  
Deselect All| Click this button to clear the list of candidates for marking as resolved.  
Mark Resolved| Click this button to have IntelliJ IDEA treat all the selected items as conflict free. The dialog closes, whereupon the Commit window shows the affected files as updated and available for submitting to the server.
