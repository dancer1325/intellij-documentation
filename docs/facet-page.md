# Facets

When you select a framework (a facet), the settings for the framework are shown in the right-hand part of the dialog.

Facets contain libraries and dependencies and provide you with additional UI elements for configuring framework-specific settings.

For more information about adding a facet, refer to [Add frameworks (facets)](adding-support-for-frameworks-and-technologies.html).
