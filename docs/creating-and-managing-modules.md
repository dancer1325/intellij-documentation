## IntelliJ IDEA modules vs Java modules

In version 9, Java introduced the [Java Platform Module System](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/). IntelliJ IDEA had already had a concept of modules: every IntelliJ IDEA module built its own classpath. With the introduction of the new Java platform module system, there appeared two systems of modularity: the IntelliJ IDEA modules, and the new Java 9 modules that are configured using module-info.java. This documentation section describes IntelliJ IDEA modules.

For more information about Java 9 support, refer to the [Support for Java 9 Modules in IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/03/support-for-java-9-modules-in-intellij-idea-2017-1/) and [Java 9 and IntelliJ IDEA](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/09/java-9-and-intellij-idea/) blog posts.
