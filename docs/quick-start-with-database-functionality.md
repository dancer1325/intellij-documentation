## Before you start

### Enable the Database Tools and SQL plugin

This functionality relies on the Database Tools and SQL plugin, which is bundled and enabled in IntelliJ IDEA by default. If the relevant features are not available, make sure that you did not disable the plugin. 

The Database Tools and SQL plugin is not available in IntelliJ IDEA without the Ultimate subscription. 

  1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open settings and then select Plugins.

  2. Open the Installed tab, find the Database Tools and SQL plugin, and select the checkbox next to the plugin name.
