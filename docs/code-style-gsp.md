## Tabs and Indents

Item| Description  
---|---  
Use tab character| Use the `Tab` key for indentation. When the checkbox is cleared, IntelliJ IDEA uses spaces instead of tabs.   
Smart tabs| 

  * If this checkbox is selected, the indentation for nested code blocks will use tabs and spaces as needed, while alignment indentation will use only spaces.
  * If this checkbox is cleared, only tabs are used. This means that a group of spaces that fits the specified tab size is automatically replaced with a tab, which may result in breaking fine alignment.

The Smart tabs checkbox is available if the Use tab character option is enabled.   
Tab size| In this field, specify the number of spaces included in a tab.  
Indent| In this field, specify the number of spaces to be inserted for each indent level.
